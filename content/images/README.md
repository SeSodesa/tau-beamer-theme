# images

Place all of your images here, if you wish to simplify their inclusion into
the presentation. This folder has been added to the `\graphicspath` of the
presentations, so this folder will be scanned for images, even if you only
provide the picture file name with `\includegraphics{image.pdf}` instead of
using a path relative to the `main.tex` files, as in
`\includegraphics{../path/to/image.pdf}`.
